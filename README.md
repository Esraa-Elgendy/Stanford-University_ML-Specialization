# Stanford University - Machine Learning Specialization
<strong><em>Machine Learning Specialization offered by Stanford University &amp; DeepLearning.ai</em></strong><br>
The Machine Learning Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.<br>
This specialization provides a broad overview of modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)<br><br>

<mark><strong><em>During this specialization, I learned to apply machine learning to challenging real-world problems by:</strong></em></mark><br>
• Building machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.<br>
• Building and training supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.<br>
• Building and training a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.<br>
• Applying best practices for machine learning development to ensure models generalize well to real-world data and tasks.<br>
• Building and using decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.<br>
• Using unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.<br>
• Building recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.<br>
• Building a deep reinforcement learning model.<br>
